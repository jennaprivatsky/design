    		<div class="product-title">GLO TAG TOY DESIGN</div>
    		<div id="glotag-info">GLO TAG is a toy created during a Toy Product Design class at the University of Minnesota. The class was sponsored by Target, and the product was created to meet Target's guidelines. <br /><br />

GLO TAG works using RFID technology. Each player wears a pack and a hand strap. When a player touches their hand strap to the target on the pack of another player, the tagged player will lose a life. The lives are represented by the colored bars on the straps of the pack. Once all lives are lost, the pack will deactivate and the player will be out. <br /><br />

Construction of GLO TAG included 3 rounds of prototyping which required electronic programming, sewing, laser cutting, and design aesthetic. <br /><br />

GLO TAG was designed by a team including myself and 4 other students in the class. </div>
